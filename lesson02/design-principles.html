      <h2>Visual Herarchy</h2>
      <p>Playstation</p>
      <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/" target="_blank">playstation.com</a>
      <div>

      <p>
        I think this website complies with the <span class="format-italic">Visual Hierarchy</span> design principle.
        Upon entering for the first time a
        user to the page is attracted by the hero image found in the banner positioned on the right side, then, the
        visual inspection turns to the left to read the title and a brief description of the advertisement, below it
        there is a call to action button to click to learn more about the product. Furthermore, I think it also complies
        with other design principles, such as: <span class="format-italic">Rule of Thirds, White Space and Clean Design,
          Proximity and Alignment.</span>
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
      <p>Sprite</p>
      <a href="https://www.coca-cola.com/us/en/brands/sprite" target="_blank">sprite.com</a>
      <div>
        <img src="images/sprite.webp"
          alt="Two cans of Sprite one next the other">
      </div>
      <p>
        In my opinion, this site complies with the Rule of Thirds principle, and in part also with other design
        principles such as: <span class="format-italic">White Space and Clean Design, Proximity, Alignment and
          Contrast</span>. I think it has a clean and orderly design, and use a <span
          class="format-italic">Minimal</span>
        principle.
      </p>

      <h2>Contrast</h2>
      <p>Cooler Master</p>
      <a href="https://www.coolermaster.com/" target="_blank">coolermaster.com</a>
      <div>
        <img src="images/coolermaster.webp"
          alt="A water cooler for a computer processor">
      </div>
      <p>
        I think Cooler Master is an innovative brand and that its website is also innovative, and it complies
        with the principle of <span class="format-italic">Contrast</span>. Other principles that I observed were:
        <span class="format-italic">Visual Herarchy</span>, has a hero image that tells the
        user what is the focal point, title, and call to action buttons. The design also seemed minimalist to me.
        I also, observer <span class="format-italic">F patterns</span> and <span class="format-italic">Rule of
          Thirds</span>
        principle.
